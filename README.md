# binaryCalculator
Simple calculator that allows calculation of binary numbers

Run using the index.html file on any browser.

This project uses both CSS and JS to show and run the calculator.
CSS gives the calculator its styling and JS gives the logic.

The calculator does allow the use of multiple operators in a single query and also prevents the use of multiple operators being used in sequence, overwriting the last operator with the new one if selected.
